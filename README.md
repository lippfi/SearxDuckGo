# SearxDuckGo
DuckDuckGo is a superb privacy-focused browser. However, it restricts you from changing the search engine and insists on exclusive use of DuckDuckGo. The goal of this fork is to introduce the ability to **change** the **search engine**. At present you can select your search engine preference between DuckDuckGo and Searx.

## Why Searx?

Searx is my preferred search engine. Searx is a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from more than 70 search services. It's also privacy focused. Additionally, searx can be used over Tor for online anonymity.

You can also host your own Searx instance and set it as a search engine in your browser.

To learn more about Searx, you can visit the [official site](https://docs.searxng.org/index.html).

### Interesting tips

To use Google search, simply prefix your queries with `!go`. For Wikipedia, use `!wp`. To search for images, type “!images”. You can even search in DuckDuckGo by using `!ddg`. Searx is cool, definitely check it out!

## Will other search engines be supported?

I have already supported the search engine that I use myself, thus I do not intend to add more search engines personally. However, thanks to my modifications, adding another search engine is not difficult. 

If you want to add your preferred search engine to help other people, feel free to create a Pull Request (PR).

## How can I help?

- You can add your favorite search engine in a PR
- You can translate the string constants that I added to other languages
- You can give this fork a star or share it, to help other people find it more easily.
